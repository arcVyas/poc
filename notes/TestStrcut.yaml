  name: "Through put test"
  component: "ais-ticketing"
  version: "1.2"
  jira: "AIS-6146"
  goal: "As per the new ticketing design, booking app will publish ticketing messages to a topic Q, which will then be routed to appropriate subscriber queues based on JMX selector configuration. Developer test on MQ side showed a 50% reduction in throughput when the JMX selector is applied.
Need to run a peformance test on AIS is to validate that we don't have a drastic impact in the overall throughput with the new design"
  acceptanceCriteria: "Validate that the JMX selector configuration on MQ side is not degrading the ticketing throughput."
